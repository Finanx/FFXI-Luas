# FFXI-Luas

Gearswap files

All of these Luas make use of sebyg666's addon GearInfo. You will need to sideload that to your Windower4 installation for haste detection and auto movement gear swapping to work.
All of these Luas make use of Dressup and Itemizer addons on the main addon page of windower
All of these Luas make use of TargetCaddie. I do not know who made target caddie i got the addon from a friend and posting a copy of what i have.

All of these Luas utilize several Key bind commands to make macros easier.
All of these Luas use Itemizer to move gear to and from Mog Satchel / Sack / Case. recommend Editing or removing before use. I use it to be able to gear more jobs with limited Inventoy space.
