# FFXI-Luas

Gearswap files

The Scripts folder is for all the keybinds that i have setup so if you use my lua and want my keybinds put the scripts folder inside /windower/scripts

If you dont use my keybinds certain things won't work such as changing weapons or magic burst toggles so be mindful of that.

The Scripts folder also sets it up to retrieve and put away gear from Mog Satchel/Sack/Case automatically on load and unload.

I did this specifically for my weapons to add more room in my mog wardrobes/inventory so i can use more jobs easily without having to grab items from slips or anything.

All of these Luas make use of sebyg666's addon GearInfo. You will need to sideload that to your Windower4 installation for haste detection and auto movement gear swapping to work.

All of these Luas make use of Dressup and Itemizer addons on the main addon page of windower.

All of these Luas make use of TargetCaddie. I do not know who made target caddie i got the addon from a friend and posting a copy of what i have.

All of these Luas use Itemizer to move gear to and from Mog Satchel / Sack / Case. recommend Editing or removing before use. I use it to be able to gear more jobs with limited Inventoy space.
